# Sort different data types using abstract classes in TypeScript
An app with TypeScrypt to sort different data types
Implemented an Interface to be able to sort any kind of data. (In this case array, string and linked list).
### using abstract classes to :
1- give access to the implemented methods to other methods that don't actually exist yet!
2- make child classes promise to implement some other method

### differences between Interfaces and Abstract Classes :
#### Interfaces: 
1- Sets up a contract between different classes <br/> 2- will use them when we have very different objects that we want to work together <br/> 3-Promotes loose coupling

#### Abstract Classes/ Inheritance 
1- Sets up a contract between different classes <br/> 2- Use when we are trying to build up a definition of an object <br/> 3- Strongly couples classes together
